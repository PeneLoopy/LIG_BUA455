### Data Management for Business 

.pull-left[
  
  - Course developed for today's **data-driven** world.

- Data is a now a **public-facing** aspect of business and management.

- Students learn how to acquire, combine, 'wrangle' and curate data 

- All assignments, tests, and final project are done in **R and Rstudio**

- Course is divided into **Four Main Parts**

### Part 1

.pull-left[

**Project Skills, Data Wrangling**

  - R coding environment, R projects, RStudio
  
    - File management and documentation
  
  - Data skills:
     - Selecting variables and formatting variables
     - filtering data
     - grouping and summarizing data
     - reshaping data for plots or tables
     - Visualizing and presenting data
    
  - Assignments 1 - 3 reinforce these skills
- ***Course Project introduced and groups determined after Part 1***

]



---

### **Part 2:**  

.pull-left[

**Importing and Combining Data from Different Sources**

  - Data formats
  - Joining datasets in different ways
  - Managing and cleaning text string data
  - Documenting and crediting data sources
  - Expanding on skills from Part 1
  
- Assignments 4 and 5 - Part 1 (Dashboard Assignment)

  - Require more advanced skills and take more time


***Data Sources and Project Ideas Introduced***
  
  - Groups submit a draft and final project proposal.

  - Students **transition from individual to group work**
  
  - **Geographic data** management
  
  - More with text, and troubleshooting data issues
  
  - Student Project Questions
  
  - Curating data in different formats, written documents, html files, slides
  
  - **Time permitting: additional 'Literate Programming' skills**
  
     - Using RStudio to create reports or slides (like this set)
     
     - Introduction to github and version control

### Part 4

**Group Project**

  - **Students Groups (5 - 6 Students) :**
     - Develop a proposal with 3 or more questions
     - Identify multiple data sources to address questions
     - Combine and curate data to develop a multi-panel dashboard


  - **Dashboard must include both:**
     - Interactive and static visualizations with explanatory text
     - Linked text citations to data sources
     
  - **Accompanying the dashboard are two written memos**

     - Memo 1: To supervisor who would have to present dashboard
     - Memo 2: to colleague on how to update dashboard


**Students manage, curate, and present data in a collaborative setting to a achieve an objective.**

- [Example Student Group Dashboard 2 (Spring 2022)](https://rpubs.com/wducott/dashboard)

### Successes

.pull-left[

- **Dashboard Project** works well for this course.

  - Students learn to apply skills and manage, present, and maintain a project.
  
- Order of course material is now more refined.
  
- Currently turning HTML lecture notes into slide decks like this
  
- BUA 455 selected to test ILTA shared competencies this Spring.
  
- **Graduate TA's are essential** to grading coding assignments and help students
  
- **Feedback has been very positive**

  - Gratifying to see students become more confident in these skills.

### Challenges

.pull-left[

- **1st Iteration:** Developed with short notice for Spring 2021 (Hybrid)

- **R and Rstudio are changing VERY rapidly**

  - 'Open Source' means more work to keep software up to date
  
- **Wide variability in student comfort level with coding** 

  - Akin to learning new languages (S, Markdown)

  - Requires practice and patience
  
- Class size is growing quickly

- **Assessment of data management skills is challenging**

### Effective Assessment Challenges

.pull-left[

- Intermediary assessment is key for the success of the course

  - Each project group should include a wide range of skills

- Testing data management skills in a timed in-class setting is unrealistic

- Take-home tests invite academic dishonesty (too much temptation)

### Solution for Assessment

.pull-left[

- **Two 70 minute in-class tests**
  
  - Test is taken in R/RStudio using provided R project and template 
  
  - 6 or 7 specific 2-3 step data management tasks with questions to answer
  
  - Template is accompanied by Blackboard questions which include R code
  
  - Blackboard allows for multiple versions of same questions
  
  - **Grade is based on both submitted R code and answers to Blackboard questions.**

### What's Next

.pull-left[

- Short-term:

  - A little more sleep

  - Creating a R code and video demo repository for data management tasks

  - Continuing to refine the material and assignments
  
- Longer-term(?):

  - Data visualization course that picks up where this one ends

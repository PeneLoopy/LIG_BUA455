### Data Management for Business 

.pull-left[
  
  - Course developed for today's **data-driven** world.

- Data is a now a **public-facing** aspect of business and management.

- Students learn how to acquire, combine, 'wrangle' and curate data 

- All assignments, tests, and final project are done in **R and Rstudio**

- Course is divided into **Four Main Parts**

### Part 1

.pull-left[

**Project Skills, Data Wrangling**

  - R coding environment, R projects, RStudio
  
    - File management and documentation
  
  - Data skills:
  
     - Selecting and formatting variables
     
     - Filtering data
     
     - Grouping and summarizing data
     
     - Reshaping data for plots or tables

.panel[.panel-name[ **Part 3** ]

**Students complete both individual and group work**

- **Individual work:**

   - **<span style="text-decoration:underline">[Assignment 5 - Part 2](https://rpubs.com/PeneLope_PE/900345)</span>** builds on prior dashboard assignment.
   
  - **Geographic data** management
  
  - More with text, and troubleshooting data issues
  
  - Time permitting: additional 'Literate Programming' skills:
  
     - Using RStudio to manage and curate data in multiple formats:
     
         - e.g. word documents, or slides (like this deck)
     
     - Introduction to GitHub and version control
     
  - **<span style="text-decoration:underline">[How to talk about skillset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_VoM3D6tPftjZpXCnTL8SKYBlOM_4KjG/view?usp=sharing)</span>**
     
<br>
     
- **Group work:** 

  - Students work on projects and submit/ask questions

### Part 4

**Group Project**

  - **Students Groups (5 - 6 Students) :**
  
     - Develop a proposal with 3 or more questions
     - Identify multiple data sources to address questions
     - Manage, combine, and curate data to develop a multi-panel dashboard

  - **Dashboard must include both:**
  
     - Interactive and static visualizations with explanatory text
     - Linked text citations to data sources
     
  - **Accompanying the dashboard are two written memos**

     - Memo 1: To supervisor who would have to present dashboard
     - Memo 2: to colleague on how to update dashboard
     - Memos include data citations and R, RStudio, and R package citations

***Students manage, curate, and present data in a collaborative setting to a achieve an objective.***

### Successes

.pull-left[

- **Dashboard Project** works well for this course.

  - Students learn to apply skills and manage, present, and maintain a data project.
  
- Order of course material is now more refined.
  
- Currently turning HTML lecture notes into slide decks like this

  - Different formats will provided to maximize assessibility
  
- BUA 455 selected to test ILTA shared competency rubric Spring 2022
  
- **Graduate TA's are essential** to grading coding assignments and help students
  
- **Feedback has been positive**

  - Students report increased confidence in their skillset.

### Challenges

.pull-left[

- **1st Iteration:** Developed with short notice for Spring 2021 (Hybrid)

- **R and Rstudio are changing VERY rapidly**

  - 'Open Source' means more work to keep software up to date
  
- **Wide variability in student comfort level with coding** 

  - Akin to learning new languages (S, Markdown)

  - Requires practice and patience
  
- Keeping course focused on data management
  
- Class size is growing quickly

- **Assessment of data management skills is challenging**

### Effective Assessment Challenges

.pull-left[

- Early and mid-course assessment is key for the success of the course

  - Each project group should include a wide range of skills

- Testing data management skills in a **timed** in-class setting is unrealistic

- Take-home tests may invite academic dishonesty 

  - Considering trying timed take-home tests in Fall of 2022

### Current Solution for Assessment

.pull-left[

- **Two 70 minute in-class tests**
  
  - Test is taken in R/RStudio using provided R project and template 
  
  - 6 or 7 specific 2-3 step data management tasks with questions to answer

  - Template is accompanied by Blackboard questions which include R code
  
  - Blackboard allows for multiple versions of same questions
  
***Grade is based on both submitted R code and answers to Blackboard questions.***

### What's Next

.pull-left[

**Short-term:**

- A little more sleep

- Creating a R code and video demo repository

- Continuing to refine the material and assignments
  
- Joint Statistical Meetings in August 2022 (Washington, D.C.)
  
   - Presenting about development of BA major and this course
  
**Longer-term (?):**

- Data visualization course that picks up where this one ends

   - Would also build on analytical skills in other BA courses
